Little Applet designed around me trying to learn GUI and PIL things in python. 
Aims to: 
    - Show the topological map of the selected area
    - Allow to mark what path you took on your hike
    - Compute some statistics of the path you have taken
    - Add photos you have taken along the path and show the locations on the map
    - Allow to expand and display the photos by clicking their location on the map
